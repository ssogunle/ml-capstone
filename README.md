This project proposes a novel approach for identifying likely RCS
subscribers by adopting supervised and unsupervised machine learning
algorithms. These
are Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering algorithm and Artificial
Neural Networks (ANN) respectively. First, the GMM clustering algorithm
generates labels for the datasetâ€™s customer groups. Thereafter, an ANN
trains the final model, which can make predictions on unseen data.
